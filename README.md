# holidaymaker
Holiday maker is a tool where administrators can book hotels to customers.
This was a task in a school assignment in a SQL-course in the fall of 2021 and beginning of 2022.
The tasks in this assignment were:

1. Design a database with E/R-diagram
2. Create a database with the E/R-diagram as reference.
3. Create a backend solution in Java with a console interface where the administrators can search for free hotels and make bookings.
